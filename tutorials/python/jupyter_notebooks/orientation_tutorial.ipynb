    "## Tutorial: Orientation detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we discuss how to automatically detect the orientation in a raw grayscale micro-CT image. In the PuMA C++ library, there are three different algorithms to detect it: the artificial flux, the ray casting approach, and the structure tensor. Each one of these methods has its pros and cons, but latter one is widely considered the state-of-the-art for detecting the local orientation directly from the raw image grayscales (please refer to [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927025620301221) for more details on the three PuMA methods). For this reason, the structure tensor method was implemented in pumapy, using Numpy's vectorized eigen value analysis routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure tensor is an image processing approach that directly operates on the grayscale values of a 3D image. Effectively, what the algorithm looks for is the direction of least grayscale gradient change at each voxel throughout the domain. It does so by applying a Derivative of Gaussian (DoG) filter, followed by an extra Gaussian smoothing of the gradients. \n",

    "The pumapy function to compute the orientation can be used in the following way:"
