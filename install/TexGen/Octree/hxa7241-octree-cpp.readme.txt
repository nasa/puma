Description
-----------

This is a general octree component in C++. It is in the form of
source-code.

It is:
 * open to various algorithms
 * non-intrusive
 * strongly typed
 * compact in code and storage

For an introductory article, see:

For the complete code archive, see:

The project is subject to refinement and improvement. Check back for
updates.




Requirements
------------

It is essentially ISO C++.

Some of the support classes depend on the standard C libraries through
float.h and math.c, in a probably easily removable way. Exception
handling is used for dealing with storage exceptions. RTTI is not
used. Only basic use is made of templates: just class templates.

The component and support code has been compiled with MinGW 3.1.0
GCC 3.4.2, and VC toolkit 2003.





Usage
-----

The file OctreeExample.cpp contains a 'minimal' example of usage.

For an item type to work with an octree, the octree needs to be able
to determine if an item overlaps a cell. The code to do that is
defined by the owner of the item, in the form of a concrete derivative
of the octree framework's agent type.

Operations to be made on an octree are defined in the form of concrete
derivatives of the octree framework's visitor class.

These mediate between your items and the octree. You can then insert
and remove items into/from an octree, and perform custom operations
reading an octree.
